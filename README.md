# JustThisPic

A SwiftUI-based photo viewer that displays **only the photo(s) you want** — and nothing more.  
No swiping, no distractions, no surprises.

Ideal for:
- Showing someone a photo without worrying they'll swipe left or right.
- Presenting selected images in a clean, immersive full-screen experience.
- Building gallery apps that emphasize intention and control.

Because sometimes you just want to show a single image — without the "hey, what's that next photo?" moment.
This viewer helps you stay in control of what gets seen.

## 🧠 Inspired by...

The iOS Photos app — but stricter. Because some people just can't resist swiping.
